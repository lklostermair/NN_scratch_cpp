# Neural Network Binary XOR Classifier in C++
A Simple Neural Network from Scratch in C++ trained to classify XOR data.
Only "tested" with Net Average Training Error, No Train/Test Split.
Network Architecture very simple, 2 input neurons, hidden layer with 4 neurons and output neuron as binary classifier.
